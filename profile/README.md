## Abstract
We implement NLP to screen web pages that contain false scientific claims. The app takes a text or a URL as input and returns a list of matches with a database. Note that the app is a prototype and is not fully functional as of 2021, December 7th.
## Credits
- [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/) supervised the original project. Le Wagon is a coding school and the project was part of a data science bootcamp (October-November 2021)
- [ScienceFeedback](https://sciencefeedback.co/) provided the original idea and the initial dataset. ScienceFeedback is an IFCN-certified, independent, third-party fact-checker for top-tier social networks. They review contents that contain scientific claims about climate and health.
